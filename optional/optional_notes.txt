Optional File Notes - 11/23/2015
------------------------------------
OpenSim.exe.config

These files will allow you to minimize logging and console output, it will also rotate your logs every 25mb of logging and seperate the Xengine output to its own log.  When your sim starts you will not see Xengine print any script logging on the console, this is normal, infact console and log output will be minimized when these files are installed. This can improve performance on busy simulators.  To install these files just copy them into your /bin folder where OpenSim.exe or OpenSim.32BitLaunch.exe exists.

osslEnable.ini 

OpenSim.ini now has an include for osslDefaultEnable.ini which is the default ossl settings and calls your osslEnable.ini (see osslEnable.ini.example) This change lets you continue to use the same osslEnable.ini you already configured. 

DO NOT EDIT osslDefaultEnable.ini
rename osslEnable.ini.example to osslEnable.ini and insert any Allow_os* you want to change! 

Defaults adjusted and already included.(no changes needed in most cases)
