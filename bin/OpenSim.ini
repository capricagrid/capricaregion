;; This is the main configuration file for OpenSimulator.
;; If it's named OpenSim.ini then it will be loaded by OpenSimulator.
;; If it's named OpenSim.ini.example then you will need to copy it to
;; OpenSim.ini first (if that file does not already exist)
;;
;; Once you have copied OpenSim.ini.example to OpenSim.ini you will at least
;; need to set the constants in the [Const] section and pick an architecture
;; in the [Architecture] section at the end of this file. The architecture
;; will require a suitable .ini file in the config-include directory, either
;; StandaloneCommon.ini or GridCommon.ini which you can copy and modify from the
;; available .example files.
;;
;; The settings in this file are in the form "<key> = <value>".  For example,
;; save_crashes = false in the [Startup] section below.
;;
;; All settings are initially commented out and the default value used, as
;; found in OpenSimDefaults.ini.  To change a setting, first uncomment it by
;; deleting the initial semicolon (;) and then change the value.  This will
;; override the value in OpenSimDefaults.ini
;;
;; If you want to find out what configuration OpenSimulator has finished with
;; once all the configuration files are loaded then type "config show" on the
;; region console command line.
